# ruby-chess
A command-line chess game implemented in Ruby.

![Oops - you got me!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alextaylor000/ruby-chess/master/demo.gif)

## Playing the game
Note: you must have Ruby 2.2 or higher.

__Step 1:__ Find a friend.

__Step 2:__ Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/alextaylor000/ruby-chess.git`).

__Step 3:__ From within the repo, start the game by typing `ruby chess.rb`.

And that's it! Select a piece and then move it by entering the notational coordinate (e.g. 'a2')

## Thanks
Thanks to [CodeCore](http://codecore.ca/) for the original chess assignment - which I took way, way too far ;)
